Welcome to my Github repo!

Currently working as a IT Support Technician, I enjoy learning about the world of devops and automation. This repo will detail some of my current homelab work with some of the following devops technologies and coding languages: 

- Ansible
- Gitlab CI/CD
- Terraform
- Bash
- Python

Currently its a bit of a work in progress as I get this caught up to my private repo.
