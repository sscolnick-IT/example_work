Welcome to my Github repo!

Currently working as a IT Support Technician, I enjoy learning about the world of Linux, devops and automation! Below are some of the topics that I have been working on that im looking to highlight. 

- Ansible
- Gitlab CI/CD
- Terraform
- Bash
- Python

Each directory contains a README file of why I wrote the code and how it is functioning in my Virtualizaion Homelab.
