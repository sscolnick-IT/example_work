Repositories containing examples and tutorials of some of my IT Projects

Interested in IT and DevOps I wanted to share some examples of work I have been doing and get some feedback from the world. 

Project topics include my work with ansible, gitlab, terraform, proxmox, bash scripting, python scripting and whatever else comes up that i've been working on.
