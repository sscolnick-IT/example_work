Welcome to my Github repo!

Currently working as a IT Technician, I enjoy learning about the world of Linux, devops and automation! As an ongoing project I have been building out a virtualization server where I have been working on deploying many devops applications in order to automate all my work. 

Below are some of the topics I touch on in this repo with some example code I have written:

- Ansible - For configuration management and pushing new changes out to multiple machines at once
- Gitlab CI/CD - as my code repository and to build CI/CD pipelines for automated code deployment to my systems
- Terraform - To automate VM infrastructure deployment on my proxmox VM server
- Bash - scripts inorder to better manage and automate jobs on running linux systems
- Python - Learning python has been a long term project for myself, currently learning how to build applications in django frameworks. I hope to get one of my projects posted uphere soon.
- RHCSA_notes - These are a collection of some of my notes I took in order to study and pass my RedHat Certified System Administrator exam. 

Each directory contains a README file of why I wrote the code and how it is functioning in my Virtualizaion Homelab.
